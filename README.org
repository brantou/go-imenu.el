  Available on all major ~package.el~ community maintained repos -
  [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/][MELPA Stable]] and [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]] repos.

  MELPA Stable is recommended as it has the latest stable version.
  MELPA has a development snapshot for users who don't mind breakage but
  don't want to run from a git checkout.

  You can install ~go-imenu~ using the following command:

  ~M-x package-install [RET] go-imenu [RET]~

  or if you'd rather keep it in your dotfiles:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (unless (package-installed-p 'go-imenu)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'go-imenu))
  #+END_SRC

  If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

  ~M-x package-refresh-contents~
